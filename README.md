## Notes about my work

I've added comments and type checking for each component. I've tried to follow the designs as closely as possible. I did get some blurry icons and mobile images, in case you wonder why some of the icons are blurry.

Most of the css lives in each component folder, but some global styles lives inside src/styles.

Thanks for the challenge.
